## Project Structure

The Random Quiz Mini Project consists of a Python script (`Random_Quiz.py`) with the following components:

- A list of 30 questions and their corresponding answers.
- Functions for selecting a random question and checking the user's answers.
- The main quiz loop, which iterates through the questions, presents them to the user, and calculates the score.
- The `__main__` function, which serves as the entry point of the program.

## Customization

You can easily customize the quiz by modifying the `questions` list to include your own questions and answers. You can also change the number of questions in the quiz by adjusting the `num_questions` variable in the script.
